# Unity-3rd-Person-Camera-Example-Script
I made this script and thought I'd post it because a lot of people looked confused / couldn't find the actual source code for the tuturial for the 3rd person camera.
just download the CamFollow.cs & CamFollow.cs.meta and add it to your project. Then attach the script to your character controller, and set the GameObject to your follow target.
You still need a movement script, but all the camera should be all set.
